"Hello World - GitHub Tutorial"  
Going through the basics of GitHub online: <br />
-Repository = basically project folder  
-Issue = a comment on the project, like to-do stuff, or bugs that need fixing, etc  
-Branch = way to work on other parts of the project without changing the original (like a copy of the project folder and you edit it then recombine it  
-Commit = saved changes
-Open pull request = proposes changes to be applied to another branch  
-Merge pull request = apply the pull request (apply changes)  

btw apparently you need 2 spaces to create a new line in this .md crap. Or you can type "br /" but replace "" with <>
Also! if you include "fixes #x" in the commit title, it will close issue #x.
